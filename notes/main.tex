\chapter{Preliminaries}

There are a few things we might need to have in mind before we start working properly in quantum cryptography.

\section{Complex Numbers}

A complex number is a numerical evaluation that has a part that is imaginary, and a part that is real.

\subsection{Complex conjugate numbers}

If $\alpha = a + ib$, then we can conjugate it as $\hat{\alpha} = a - ib$. This is interesting because if we multiply these
numbers, we arrive to:

\begin{gather}
    a \cdot \hat{a} = a^2 - i^2 b^2 = a^2 + b^2
\end{gather}

this is equal to the square of the magnitude a complex number has in representing both the real and the complex space.

\section{Euler's Identity}

Say for example we let the function $f(\theta) = ( cos{\theta} + i \sin{\theta} ) e^{-i\theta}$
where $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$

we can assume then from derivating this expression:

\begin{gather}
    \frac{df(\theta)}{d\theta}
\end{gather}

This equation is a constant because of this derivative,
and therefore we can calculate f(0) and it will equal the same for all real values.

\begin{gather}
    f(0) = ( cos{0} + i \sin{0} ) e^{-i * 0}
\end{gather}

$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

This can also be proved through Taylor series or extend it to square matrices, however,
as it stands right now, we just need to use it for working on imaginary numbers, so this is the
result that happens to become relevant to us.

\section{The Stern-Gerlach experiment}

We can prove a few quantum properties through this experiment, and it will theoretically fundament a bunch of our calculations.
So, given an iron magnet, and macroscopic parcticles,

\chapter{Information in quantum systems.}

Quantum information is, in essence, a multidisciplinary field somewhere in the middle
of physics, mathematics, and computer science. While mostly a theoretical field at this point,
but in essence, we can think on it as a way to solve problems unsolvable by current systems, that
are based on the Von Neumann architecture. Of course, this is a pretty versatile architecture that
can be used for a lot of stuff, but it might have a few limitations we're slowly crawling towards.

A lot of complex calculations are intractable for Von Neumann computers, as for example
is the case for factorization, which ends up happening to give us modern classical cryptography. In that same vein,
there are different natural problems with such systems.

For example, Caffeine ( $C_{8}H_{10}N_{4}O_{2}$ ) is a 24 atom molecule, and it requires for those 24 atoms, $10^{48}$ bits
for describing all possible energy arrangements. And yet, 160 qubits can represent the model on
it's completeness, as a $2^{160} = 1.46 \cdot 10^{48}$ system in the complex space.

For another application in chemistry, let's imagine a block of mineral Carbon (C), such material can be layered into
layers to create graphite, or another form of such atoms, diamonds are also composed from carbon in molecules, and yet
mineral Carbon  has wildly different properties. This are problems that don't have structural forms that can be fully simulated
in classical computers. Materials Science will probably find a lot of uses for quantum information in the realms of simulation and
data modeling. We'll probably end up needing better quantum computers, but the important thing is we'll find that such technologies will
become incredibly useful.

In layman's terms, quantum computers will:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Make it possible to represent unrepresentable information
    \item Generate calculations at a much faster rate bit-to-qubit (we'll see what a qubit is later) per second
    \item ...probably break some cryptographic systems, we'll also get to that.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Qubit}

A qubit is a bit of a weird system, as it represents a quantum state somewhere between $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$.
As quantum computing tends to work, this is of a probabilistic variable, and won't be .
